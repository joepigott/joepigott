I'm Joe, and I'm a student at USU. I'm currently writing software for the USU-NASA collaboratory AWE mission (it sounds more
impressive than it is). I have plenty of side-projects to keep me busy, mostly written in my preferred language Rust.

If it seems like my activity here has been lacking recently, it's because I moved all of my personal projects to my
[self-hosted Gitea instance](https://git.pigroy.xyz). You're welcome to browse them there, or contact me to request an
account.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I'm passionate about privacy and open-source software, so if
you'd like to collaborate with me on something, I'd love to hear it! You can reach me at pigroy@pigroy.xyz or through activity
on one of my repositories.
